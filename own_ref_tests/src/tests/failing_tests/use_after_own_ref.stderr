error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `text`
 --> src/tests/failing_tests/use_after_own_ref.rs:8:5
  |
4 |     let text = "Hello".to_owned();
  |         ---- move occurs because `text` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
5 |
6 |     new_own_ref!(owned_ref, text);
  |     ----------------------------- value moved here
7 |
8 |     assert_eq!(text, owned_ref.take());
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ value borrowed here after move
  |
  = note: this error originates in the macro `assert_eq` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
